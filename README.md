# DiceRoller
This lets you roll dice for tabletop games

So far I have three different folders. One with the logic working the way I want it to, but with a less than appealing design; One with better design, and working logic; And an experiment I'm starting with 3d objects and the Trackball.js from eleqtriq.com.

I'll be working on this for a while, And will make a new FINISHED folder with the final product, or at least version 1.0.
